# isbnBookInfoGet

With this software you are able to get information about books by [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number).

The [software for the user](https://github.com/1amn0body/isbnBookInfoGet/blob/main/isbnBookInfoGet.py) uses a loop that can only be ended with 'x' or Ctrl + C. The one [for external software](https://github.com/1amn0body/isbnBookInfoGet/blob/main/isbnBookInfoGet-1in1out.py), however, gets an input and gives an output.

In both cases the output is structured according to this scheme: 'Title, Book series, Author(s), Input ISBN'

The executable .exe file is built with [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/).
